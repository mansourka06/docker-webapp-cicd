Building CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Github and Docker for WebApplication deployment.


![Alt text](pipeline_description.jpg)

## Description:
In this project, I've established a robust CI/CD pipeline for seamless web application deployment using Jenkins Pipelines. The pipeline automates the entire process, from code integration to deployment, ensuring efficient and error-free delivery. By following these steps, you can implement a similar CI/CD setup for your own web projects.


## Steps:

### Install and Configure Jenkins:

Start by installing Jenkins on your server or preferred environment. Access the Jenkins dashboard and install necessary plugins like Git, Pipeline, and any specific tools your project requires.

### Set Up Version Control:

Connect your project to a version control system like Git. Create a repository and push your code to it. This forms the basis for tracking changes and triggering the pipeline.

### Create a Jenkins Pipeline:

Navigate to Jenkins and create a new pipeline project. Define the pipeline's source as your version control repository (e.g., GitHub). Configure Jenkins to monitor the repository for changes.

### Define Pipeline Stages:

Design your pipeline stages according to your project's needs. Common stages include:

- Checkout: Fetch the latest code from the repository.
- Build: Compile code, install dependencies, and generate artifacts.
- Test: Run automated tests to ensure code quality.
- Deploy: Deploy the application to a testing/staging environment.
- Promote: Manual approval step to promote the build to production.
- Cleanup: Perform any necessary cleanup tasks.

### Script Pipeline Steps:

Within each stage, script the necessary steps using the Jenkins Pipeline DSL (Domain Specific Language). For example, use shell commands, build tools, or deployment scripts to execute tasks.

## Configure Deployment Environments:
Define the environments where your application will be deployed. This could include testing, staging, and production environments, each with their own configurations.

### Implement Continuous Monitoring:

Integrate monitoring tools to track application performance and health. Set up alerts to notify the team in case of issues.

### Trigger Automated Deployments:

Configure Jenkins to automatically trigger the pipeline whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This ensures that code changes go through the defined stages consistently.

### Manual Approvals (Optional):

If your pipeline includes a manual approval step for deploying to production, ensure that the process is user-friendly and clearly documented.

### Iterate and Improve:

Regularly review and refine your CI/CD pipeline. Integrate user feedback and adapt to changing project requirements.

By following these steps, you can establish an efficient CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins that automates the deployment of your web applications, increases collaboration, and reduces the risk of errors during the release process.
